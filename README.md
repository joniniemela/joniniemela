## Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer from Lappeenranta, Finland. I am passionately interested in computers and technology and always looking for new problems and challenges to defeat.

I am currently focusing on Full stack applications development with several modern tools & frameworks:
- React with Next.js
- REST API development

I have experience on several languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS (Typescript)
- Python
- Lua
- C#
- SQL

My main principle is writing code that is clean, scalable and efficient.

I am also experienced in deployment and infrastructure management with several different environments:

- Google Cloud Platform
- On-premises hardware virtualization platforms (VMware, Proxmox, Hyper-V)
- Software virtualizations with Docker
